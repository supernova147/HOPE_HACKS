To Do List
[✅] Render map w/ marker using Google Maps API
[✅] Fetched static data from Google Maps Geocoding API
    [✅] Refactor function to accept dynamic input
        [✅] Get user query for location
        [✅] Change user input of semantic places to correlated lat and long coordinate
        [] (NICE-TO-HAVE) Auto-prompt for user location for default location
[✅] Center user query's location in the map
[✅] Fetch clinics' information from NCOne API
    [✅] Filter clinics to return only clinics near query location (lat and long)
[] Render markers for all clinics within the query location
[] Rework query so that another input box takes the facility names(?) => might scrap this

DEBUG
[] Keep map static when users enter a query outside of NC's bounds
    [] Give back an error message
